##### Changes to Go 

#### Addition of new built-ins - min & max

`min`  and `max` compute smallest/largest value of multiple *ordered types*

```go
func main() {
	var x, y = 42, 22
	m := min(x)      // m == 42
	n := min(x, y)   // n == 22
	o := max(x, y)   // o == 42
}
```

##### Changes to Go 

#### Addition of new built-ins - min & max

```go
func main() {
	var x, y = 42, 22
	m := min(x, y, 8)       // m == 8
	n := max(1, 2.0, 10)    // c == 10.0 (float64)
	o := max(0, float32(x)) // o == 42 (float32)
	p := max("Hei", "Gopher", "at", "ioki", "office")
	//s := []string{"Hei", "Gophers", "at", "ioki", "office"}
	// "invalid operation: invalid use of ... with built-in min"
	//_ = min(s...)                 
}
```

##### Changes to Go 

#### Addition of new built-ins - min & max ü§ø

- String arguments
	- smallest/largest lexically byte-wise 
	- associative: `min(x, y, z) = min(min`(x, y), z) = min(x, min(y, z))
- Numeric arguments
	- commutative: `min(x, y) = min(y, x)`
	- associative: `min(x, y, z) = min(min(x, y), z) = min(x, min(y, z))`

[Playground Example](https://play.golang.com/p/Y-yl059_Ei8)

##### Changes to Go 

#### Addition of new built-ins - min & max ü§ø

- Floating point arguments
	- NaN "wins always"
	- -0.0 is smaller than 0.0 
	- -Inf is smaller than any other number
	- +inf is larger than any other number

##### Changes to Go 

#### Addition of new built-ins - clear

`clear` "zeros" all elements from a map, slice, or type parameter type

```go
s := []string{"Hei", "lovely", "Gophers", "at", "our", "meetup!"}
clear(s) // s == [    ], len 6
m := map[string]string{"host": "ioki", "title": "Go 1.21 karaoke"}
clear(m) // m == [   ], len 0
```

#### Addition of new built-ins - clear

> [!info]

###### Generics: Improvements Type Inference

If generic function initialised with generic functions as arguments, type inference is now also for each argument of the generic function that is not yet fully instantiated.

> [!faq] When relevant? 
> Generic functions operating on containers with arguments that can be generic functions itself, such as `slices.IndexFunc()`

note: Type inference to infer missing type arguments of the callee ("old")

---
###### Generics: Improvements Type Inference

> [!tip] Type Inference in Go 1.21
> Type inference more robust and powerful overall.

- multiple differently typed untyped constant arguments behave as inference for constant expressions
- type inference precise for matching types in assignments:  component types need to be identical or inference fail.  ‚ùóÔ∏è previously compiler may have inferred incorrect type

---
###### Generics: Improvements Type Inference

Type inference considers now methods too:
- type arguments for type parameters of a method signature may inferred from parameter types of matching methods
- methods of type argument and constraints are matched -> may infer more type arguments 

---
##### Core Library

#### New log/slog package

- Go has structured logging üéâ 
- more efficient logging for large data without third-party libraries
- `log/slog` can be integrated into popular log analysis tools and services
- `slog.Info("hei gophers", "host", "ioki")` -> `2022/22/08 18:30:00 INFO hei gophers host=ioki`

[Package](https://go.dev/pkg/log/slog)

---

##### Core Library

#### New testing/slogtest package

- enable validation of `slog.Handler` code
- `slog.Handler` handles logs from a certain level and above

[Package](https://go.dev/pkg/testing/slogtest) | [Sentry Handler for slog](https://github.com/samber/slog-sentry)

---

##### Core Library

#### New slices and maps package

Provide common operations on slices and maps (powered by Generics)

```go
numbers := []int{42, 22, 8}
numbers = slices.Delete(numbers, 1, 2) // [42,8]
i := slices.Index(numbers, 8) // 1
j := slices.Index(numbers, 32) // -1
```

---

##### Core Library

#### New cmp package

1 type (*Ordered*) + 2 functions  (*Less* and *Compare*) useful for ordered types
```go
	a := cmp.Compare(8, 42) // -1
	b := cmp.Compare(42, 8) // 1
	c := cmp.Compare(42, 42) // 0
	d := cmp.Less(8, 42) // true
	e := cmp.Less(42, 8) // false
```

##### Experimental Language Changes

#### LoopvarExperiment

```go
	var prints []func()
	for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
		prints = append(prints, func() { fmt.Println(i) })
	}
	for _, print := range prints {
		print() // currently: 4, 4, 4; expected: 1, 2, 3
	}
```

Enable with `GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar`.

> [!faq] Is my code affected?
> $ go build -gcflags=all=-d=loopvar=2 cmd/go

---

##### Behaviour Changes

#### Panic of Goroutines

- `panic(nil interface value | untyped nil)` -> run-time panic (`*runtime.PanicNilError`)
- -> If a goroutine panicks and recover was called directly by a deferred function -> return value is guaranteed to != nil 
- support backward compatbility: 
	- set `GODEBUG=panicnil=1` 
	- default for any main package in a module <= go 1.20

---

#### Further Specify Rules for Package Initialisation

> [!faq] When relevant? 
> Program relies on initialisation order of implicit imports.

```
packages := {all packages}
packages = sort(packages, by=importPath)
for packages {
   pkg := firstPackageAllImportInitialized(packages)
   initialize(pkg)
   packages = remove(packages, pkg)
}
```
